	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>	I am a 3rd year student at the Illinois Institute of Technology and I am studying computer science. I am currently working towards a coterminal master's degree in computer science and plan to graduate in December of 2024 or May of 2025. I am passionate about writing high quality software and learning about programming languages. In addition to this, I also like rocketry and embedded systems. The current programming language I am learning is Rust and I am doing so by working on an open-source Discord bot with some other devolpers. Long-term I hope to write and design programs in order to benifit humanity.</p>
