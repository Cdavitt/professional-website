This is a fairly simple website with a nav section on the top that links to my about me and my resume. The resume has contact info for my email, Github, and LinkedIn and a link to download the paper verion of my resume. The resume section has my professional summary, expierence, education, and skills info on it. On the about me secion it has a simple biography. The code in the background is from a open source Discord bot I am working with some other people to devolp. The color scheme is from https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox. If I had more time I would like to add a projects section with links to past and current projects. I would also like to have a showcase section for some interesting class projects I have done. Additionally, as a side project, I would like to learn a little bit of Typescript and make a small page showcasing that. I have mostly worked with compiled languages and java and have never learned Javascript or Typescript. I would also like to fix the navigation buttons as they seem a little bit off and maybe enlarge those buttons a bit. I would also like to expand the abut me section to include a bit more info than it currently does.
